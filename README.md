# Schizophrenia-detection-using-3D-CNN-Grad-CAM
This project develops an end-to-end deep learning framework to classify structural MRI (sMRI) scans into schizophrenia and healthy control groups using 3D CNNs. It automatically learns spatial brain features from volumetric data and provides interpretable insights into brain regions linked to schizophrenia.
